# Image Tool Assortment

Recently I made a repository called [image-effects](https://github.com/enbyss/image-filters) which effectively hosts a custom-made library for applying effects to images.

These effects include anything from *dithering*, *brightness*, *gradient mapping*, *hue rotation* and more.

**This repository** is a *Cargo workspace* designed to host an assortment of packages that utilize the `image-filters` library in multiple ways. Currently the packages involved are:

- **`nasa-apod-generator`**: Automatically retrieves an image using NASA's APOD API
